# Summary
While I did not get all of the data that I wanted out of this set currently, I did find that the White-Breasted Nuthatch is a little more active during December and January.  My speculation is that it's harder to forage food at those times and they might be hitting up local feeders (they do show up at my feeders during that time.)   I was hoping to see a different correlation but i guess not seeing any wild changes between seasons should be expected, there are numerous native birds that do not migrate out of Ohio during the winter seasons.  I am not done with this dataset quite yet, I am curious to see if we start seeing more migratory birds showing up in March and April and maybe some of our winter birds like the Dark-Eyed Junco are leaving around that time.  

Can tell you one thing, birds are neat!
